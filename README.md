# cfx-twitchevents
Repo request from a viewer who wanted to spawn peds on me using reward points.  
  
This mod requires a small amount of setup. and a persisance shell to constantly refresh tokens.  
it is NOT deisgned for release, however if you want to use it, fork it, and use if for your own needs, 
you will be reposnsible for the setup though. the Most i go into the token system in THIS mod is using them.  
if you wish to create your own... go here and rip apart the auth.  
[twitch auth javascript functions](https://github.com/mikethemadkiwi/bawt/blob/master/twitchauth/mk_twitchauth.js)  
  
This mod will NOT be placed for sale or customized for specific cities.  
So to those who asked for it to be paywalled. Fugg you. "I" wrote it.. not you.  
It will remain OPEN SOURCE. Go pedal your copypasta elsewhere.  
  

PUBLIC NOTICE::  
GIVING ITEMS SPECIFICALLY TO ONE GROUP IN RETURN FOR SUBS BREAKS CFX TOS.  
DO NOT USE THIS CODE TO BREAK THOSE TERMS. YOU WILL BE LIABLE. NOT ME.  
YOU SHOULD ONLY BE USING THIS CODE TO GIFT TO EVERYONE ON EVENTS YOU CHOSE.  
EXAMPLE: if a user subs, you can gift the entire city player population cash, or free food and drinks.  
^^ this example would NOT break TOS.  
Example 2: User presses a channel button and a angry ped is spawned on you.  
^^ also fine.  
  
Either way... Enjoy!
